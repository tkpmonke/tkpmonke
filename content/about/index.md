I'm TKPMonke, a software developer in C, C++, and Lua. I've been programming since about 2021.

I'm a diehard linux user (arch btw) and a FOSS activist.

I come from the falling states of America.

To be honest, I don't really know what i'll put on here xD. I'll probably do a variety of things. Some movie/tv show/album reviews every once in a while, mixed with rants about random stuff is probably going to be the majority.

You can find me on Discord, as its the social media I use the most.
